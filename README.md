# OVID_TO_PUBMED
This brilliant little script by Amal-Alharbi works to convert multi-line complex OVID queries to a single-line PubMed format. 

I have forked it and given him a star because there is a general lack of such open source tools avaiable presently. Here is how the demo works:

```
python convert_OVID_PUBMED.py query.txt
```
query.txt --> contains the query in OVID format

output file: pubmed.txt --> contains the query in PubMed format

works with python 3.8.5 and 3.10 which I used to test it prior to modding
